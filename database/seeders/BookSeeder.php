Bella sits next to Edward in biology class on her first day of school, but he seems repulsed by her, offending her in the process. He disappears for a few days, but warms up to Bella upon his return; their newfound relationship is interrupted after Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot.

Disturbed and riddled by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. Much to her dismay, she then realizes that Edward hadn\'t come to school on the blood typing day, because he is a vampire; she compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens, and finds many similarities.

Before he can finish her, Edward and other Cullens rescue her and kill James. He still attacks the girl. Edward prevents her from becoming a vampire, and she is treated at a hospital.

Sometime after losing Edward, Bella starts to enjoy Jacob\'s company and friendship. After spending some time with Bella, Jacob starts experiencing some unexpected and drastic changes with his mood swings, body, and personality. As Jacob undergoes a very long, painful and life-altering transformation, Bella and Charlie become concerned. A few weeks later, Bella notes that Jacob isn\'t as happy-go-lucky as he once was. She isn\'t so comfortable with Jacob\'s recent changes, and shortly thereafter, she discovers that Jacob has unwillingly become a werewolf, and that there are other tribe members who are werewolves too.

In contrast to Edward\'s rash reaction to the news of Bella\'s death, Alice Cullen cleverly makes a surprise visit to Bella\'s house, which overwhelms Bella. Bella asks a series of questions, and Alice tells her that she saw Bella trying to kill herself. As Alice\'s visions about Edward change rapidly, Alice and Bella are unable to clearly understand whether Edward is or will be safe. They rush to Italy to prevent Edward from revealing himself to humans so the Volturi are forced to kill him, arriving just in time to stop him. Before leaving Italy, the Volturi tell Edward that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire to protect the secret. When they return to Forks, Edward tells Bella that he has always loved her and only left Forks to protect her. She forgives him, and the Cullens vote in favor of Bella being transformed into a vampire, to Rosalie and Edward\'s dismay. However, Jacob sternly reminds Edward about an important part of their treaty: if the Cullens bite a human for any reason, the treaty is over and the wolves will attack. When Bella reminds him that it\'s none of his concern as being a vampire is what she wants, Jacob reveals it is his business as she doesn\'t understand what\'s going to be at stake for her and the Cullens. Before he can continue warning her, they hear Charlie asking Bella to get inside the house at once. Jacob apologizes to Bella once more before leaving, and the story concludes with Charlie grounding Bella for running off to Italy.</p>                                                  ', 2, 8, 1),

Alice takes Bella away against her wishes for a sleepover. During the sleepover, Bella learns more of Rosalie\'s past that led to her eventual transformation to a vampire and her real reasons for treasuring humanity. While being a vampire is still her wish, Bella eventually agrees to rethink her decision. A few days later, Edward proposes to Bella and, despite harboring an aversion to marriage, she accepts on the condition that he will make love to her while she\'s human.</p><p style=\"margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif;\">Bella and the Cullens soon realize that the Seattle murders are being committed by an \"army\" of newborn vampires, controlled by Victoria.

Bella stops Jacob by kissing him, and she comes to realize that she is in love with him as well. During the battle, Victoria tracks Edward\'s scent to Bella\'s forest hiding place, and Edward is forced to fight. Edward manages to kill Victoria and her vampire army is destroyed by the Cullens. Afterwards, Bella explains to Jacob that while she loves him, her love for Edward is far greater. The book ends with Bella proceeding to tell Charlie of her intentions to marry Edward.</p><p style=\"margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: inherit; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: sans-serif;\">The epilogue reveals that Jacob is heartbroken and has run away in his wolf form.
